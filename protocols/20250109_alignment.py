# - have approximate sample length (and width?) somewhere
# - package with functions specific to scan analysis. this has no place in logbook2mouse
# - what modifications from branch 2_multisampleholder are worth keeping?
# - how to store alignment result
#   + just in nxs file? -> need to label this file
#   + create sampleposition dict from nxs file (?)
